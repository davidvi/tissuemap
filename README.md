## About TissueViewer

TissueViewer is designed to efficiently handle high-resolution multiplex imaging files, such as those generated by Orion Rarecyte or Keyence Immuno Fluorescence scanners. It supports multi-channel images and allows users to add annotations, customize colors, and adjust signal intensities for each channel. Your suggestions for additional features are highly welcomed!

### Run as Docker

To run TissueViewer within a Docker container, follow these steps. This setup allows you to run the viewer and automatically watch a folder for new image files, which will then be processed into multiple deep zoom images.

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   Start by building the Docker image from your Dockerfile. This image will include all the necessary dependencies and configurations to run TissueViewer.

   ```bash
   docker build -t tv .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   Run the Docker container by mapping your local directories to the appropriate directories within the container. This allows the application to access and store data on your local machine.

   - `-p 8080:8080` maps the port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host, allowing you to access the viewer via `localhost:8080`.
   - `-v /your/local/import/directory:/iv-import` maps your local directory for importing images to the corresponding directory in the container.
   - `-v /your/local/storage/directory:/iv-store` maps your local directory for storing processed images to the corresponding directory in the container.
   - `-v /your/local/completed/directory:/iv-completed` maps your local directory for storing processed images to the corresponding directory in the container.

   Run the following command, replacing `/your/local/import/directory` and `/your/local/storage/directory` with the paths to your actual directories:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /your/local/import/directory:/iv-import -v /your/local/storage/directory:/iv-store -v /your/local/completed/directory:/iv-completed tv
   ```

After executing these steps, TissueViewer will be running inside the Docker container, monitoring the specified import directory for new files to process, and accessible through your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
